# Ulock

Teensy wrapper around gpg, mostly to make it easier to lock up my project euler files

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ulock'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ulock

## Usage

`ulock --help`

## Dependencies

Heavily dependent on gpg, and (so far) doesn't walk through the configuration of a secret key. Your gpg has to be set up correctly already.

## License

The gem is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

## Code of Conduct

Everyone interacting in the Ulock projectâ€™s codebases, issue trackers, chat rooms and mailing lists is expected to follow the [code of conduct](https://github.com/[USERNAME]/ulock/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
